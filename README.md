# Genetic and HLA study of paraneoplastic syndromes 

## Use permit and author declaration 
This project was created under Stanford School of Medicine's Sleep Unit with Dr. Emmanuel Mignot as Principal Investigator. Any data belonging to the project, including but not limited genetic markers, HLA imputations, or final diagnosis have been removed from the repository to protect patients' and comply with data usage regulation. No Patient Health Information protected under HIPPA regulation was included in the project. The author discourages the use of the code for other purposes but the one intended in this project, but discloses the methods utilized to serve as an inspiration for other researchers.  

## Introduction 

Paraneoplastic syndromes (PS) are a group of rare disorders triggered by a abnormal immune response to a tumor or "neoplasm". PSs are hypothesized to occur when cancer-fighting cells antibodies or white blood cells (T-cells) attack healthy cells in the neural system in a process called cross-reactivity. This process, takes place when cell surface proteins that are naturally found in other parts of the body (the neural system) are synthesized by the tumor, activating an immune response.

In this project we studied the genetic profile of anti-LGI1 encephalitis, a subtype of limbic encephalitis (LE) characterized by presence of LGI1 antibodies in the Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF). It is characterized by a myriad of clinical presentations and symptom specificity including seizures, memory problems, irritability, depression, confusion and dementia. Tipically, LE was considered a PS but new antibodies unnassociated with tumors in LE patients suggests the posibility of an autoimune explanation to this condition.

The principal aim of this study was to:
1. Identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) associatied with LGI1 LE.
2. Identify Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) associated with LGI1 LE.
3. Idenetify specific Amino Acids (AA) associated with LGIE LE.

# Genome Wide Association Study

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in a control versus case paradigm to identify variants associated with a trait (i.e. a condition in cases). If one of the variants (one allele) is significantly more present in cases it is said to be *associated* with the disease. The associated SNPs mark a region in the genome that may influence the risk of the disease. 

We studied the associated genetic variants of LGI1 LE by performing a GWAS. The code belonging to this part of the study is located in the folger *GWAS*. For more information, please refer to the directory. 

# Human Leukocyte Antigen analysis

The Human Leukocyte Antigen system (HLA) is a group of proteins encoded by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (HMC) gene complex in humans. These cell-surface proteins are responsible for the regulation of the immune system and for triggering immune responses when a foreign organism is encountered.

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system or complex is a group of related proteins that are encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene complex in humans.[1] These cell-surface proteins are responsible for the regulation of the immune system. The HLA gene complex resides on a 3 Mbp stretch within chromosome 6p21. HLA genes are highly polymorphic, which means that they have many different alleles, allowing them to fine-tune the adaptive immune system. The proteins encoded by certain genes are also known as antigens, as a result of their historic discovery as factors in organ transplants. Different classes have different functions:
