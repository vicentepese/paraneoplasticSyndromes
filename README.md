# Genetic and HLA study of paraneoplastic syndromes 

## Use permit and author declaration 
This project was created under Stanford School of Medicine's Sleep Unit with Dr. Emmanuel Mignot as Principal Investigator. Any data belonging to the project, including but not limited genetic markers, HLA imputations, or final diagnosis have been removed from the repository to protect patients' and comply with data usage regulation. No Patient Health Information protected under HIPPA regulation was included in the project. The author discourages the use of the code for other purposes but the one intended in this project, but discloses the methods utilized to serve as an inspiration for other researchers.  

## Introduction 

Paraneoplastic syndromes (PS) are a group of rare disorders triggered by a abnormal immune response to a tumor or "neoplasm". PSs are hypothesized to occur when cancer-fighting cells antibodies or white blood cells (T-cells) attack healthy cells in the neural system in a process called cross-reactivity. This process, takes place when cell surface proteins that are naturally found in other parts of the body (the neural system) are synthesized by the tumor, activating an immune response.

In this project we studied the genetic profile of anti-LGI1 encephalitis, a subtype of limbic encephalitis (LE) characterized by presence of LGI1 antibodies in the Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF). It is characterized by a myriad of clinical presentations and symptom specificity including seizures, memory problems, irritability, depression, confusion and dementia. Tipically, LE was considered a PS but new antibodies unnassociated with tumors in LE patients suggests the posibility of an autoimune explanation to this condition.

The principal aim of this study was to:
i- Identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) associatied with LGI1 LE.
ii- Identify Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) associated with LGI1 LE.
iii- Idenetify specific Amino Acids (AA) associated with LGIE LE.
